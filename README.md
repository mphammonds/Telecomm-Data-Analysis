# Telecomm Churn Data Analysis
Statistical analysis and machine learning project on customer churn data.

The Jupyter Notebook contains a project report on publicly available customer data for a telecommunications company, including account, services, and churn information.
All analysis is done using Python, though one particular section uses the package ryp2 and IPython cell magics to run R code within Python.
